# STA304-NBA-Shot-Analysis

This repository includes the cleaned dataset from NBA Savant, "NBASavantData", which is serving as our training set and the NBA Stats API, "NBAStatsAPI", which is serving as our test set. In this repository, you'll also find a PDF document detailing the analysis of the report. Both of these ZIP files are cleaned and ready to run with the provided RMarkdown code upon submission of the assignment.

The cleaning code of "NBASavantCleaning" can be sourced from the original GitHub user's repository which can be found here: https://github.com/ebaek/NBAShotTracker
